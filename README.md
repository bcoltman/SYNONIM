# SYNONIM

**SYNONIM**  
*SYNthetic cOmmunity desigN via approxIMation*

SYNONIM is a modular framework for designing synthetic microbial communities (SynComs). It enables researchers to translate high-dimensional genomic or functional data into optimized community design.

SYNONIM is currently in active development. Updates, detailed usage instructions and test cases will be released in due course.

## Key Features

- Select optimal combinations of isolates based on functional profiles
- Incorporate metadata (e.g. taxonomy) as constraints during optimization
- Design synthetic communities from isolate collections or metagenomic profiles
- Supports both mathematical and biologically meaningful objectives
